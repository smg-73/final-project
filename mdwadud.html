    <p>
      As we all know, health is wealth. A healthy body can boost the
      productivity of doing any task, making it more efficient than an unhealthy
      body. Unfortunately, there are some objects that are directly and
      unknowingly affecting our health every day. One of the greatest issues is
      an unbounded use of technology. The technology was always a better idea
      for humankind, but nowadays, it is becoming harmful for our society. It
      affects family, children, and community in many ways. We are getting new
      and irregular symptoms that have not existed before. We can say it is an
      early threat to our next generation if we do not use technology the right
      way. Unlimited use of digital technologies can cause failing memories,
      emotional instability, strained vision, hearing loss, muscle and joint
      pain, heart trouble, premature death, and addiction.
